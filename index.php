        <h1>Why Do Social Media Marketing Is First Option? Is It a Wise Investment? </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col col-12">
        <p>There’s a lot of doubt in the startup & enterprise ecosystem on whether or not a brand should consider investing money in social media marketing. Especially because of two major reasons: </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col col-12">
        <ul>
          <li>Extremely limited reach with < 1% of your following able to receive the content you post </li>
          <li>Heavy operational involvement is required from the brand side to create really successful campaigns </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col col-12">
        <p>Both are extremely valid reasons and to be honest, thus, investing in a social media agency is NOT for everyone. The answer would depend on what stage of the business you are in. </p>
        <p>If you’re a new bootstrapped business (say for example selling t-shirts for men & women), with limited budgets, in the early experimental stages of your business, you should ideally stay away from social media marketing. We suggest this because, in the early stages of a business, they should ideally spend their time acquiring a constant stream of revenues & customers. This could happen via performance marketing, partnerships, networking, and more. Once a steady input of revenue, customers & thus customer insights is established, is when you should focus on hiring a social media marketing agency. </p>

      <div class="col col-12">
        <p>There are so many social media marketing agencies in Mumbai. If you were to hire one, what would you really use to judge them? The obvious answers include - past work, the scope of work & pricing. As a social media agency, we feel there's a lot more to this. One key factor is processing. That’s because social media marketing is a super collaborative effort. It involves talent from multiple verticals like - social media executives, copywriters, strategists, graphic designers, motion graphic designers, creative directors, and more to all work together in tandem with a crystal-clear clarity on what we want to try and achieve for the brand in say 6 months or 12 months. Apart from that, collaboration leads to dependencies, which leads to delays and that leads to compromise in the quality and thus last-minute iterations and painful last-minute deliveries to clients. </p>
        <p>So as a social media marketing agency, we did the obvious things first like - fixing up a great scope of work, hiring the best talent we could, keeping a competitive price for our clients, and building a great portfolio of the work we’d in the past and invested in the world’s best social media analytics tool. But apart from that, where we really make a stark difference is our investment in the processes. We use project management tools to come together on the same page, and assign tasks, we have internal processes like ‘Sharktank’ where people pitch their campaign ideas and are evaluated by our directors, and we’ve established ground rules of what a good social media project should look like. </p>
